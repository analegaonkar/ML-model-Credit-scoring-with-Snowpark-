In this scenario, Bank wants to use their existing credit files to analyze the current credit standings on whether the loans are being paid without any issues, and/or if there are any delays/default.

Based on the current credit standing, Snowbank wants to build a machine learning credit scoring algorithm based on the dataset to be able to automate an assessment on whether a loan should be approved or declined.
